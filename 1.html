      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Are you a BYU-I student who lives far from home? I know I am. I have
        this problem where I have more stuff than I can fit in a suitcase and a
        backpack, so I have to either find someone who can keep my extra stuff
        or throw it away. That’s what this company, DirectSHED is for! It’s a
        storage company where you can rent out a storage shed and leave your
        extra stuff there for when you come back the next semester. You can go
        to their website if you want more information on things like size,
        security, prices, and location.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        DirectSHED is meant for BYU-I students who need more space to store
        their stuff in their off-semesters while they're at home. People who
        don't have cars to drive all of their stuff home with and don't want to
        throw it all away either are the type of people DirectSHED is for.

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:

        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">[#2F6690]</td>
          <td class="secondary">[#3A7CA5]</td>

          <td class="accent2">[#16425B]</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Arial Black
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose Arial Black as my heading font because of its bold
        characteristic. I want it to be clear that these are headers, while at
        the same time maintaining a simple and easy to read font.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Segoe UI
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because it's a fairly simple font and doesn't stand
        out too much. Since there will be a lot of text in this font, I wanted
        it to be simple and very easy to read in paragraphs, and I think this
        font accomplishes that.

      </p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.

      <h4>What is DirectSHED?</h4>
      <p>
        DirectSHED is a storage unit in Rexburg, Idaho built specifically for
        college students (though anybody is welcome to rent a unit) who live far
        from home and can’t bring all of their stuff home in between semesters.
        <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> DirectSHED is not a real business and none
        of the locations, numbers, prices, images, etc. are accurate depictions
        of these non-existent storage units.
      </p>
      <h4>Why DirectSHED?</h4>
      <p>
        DirectSHED is a high quality and cheaper alternative to the other
        storage units in Rexburg. Our storage units are more convenient than
        other units around town because of our close proximity to the BYU-I
        campus, our cheap, easy rentals, and our competitive price match system
        to other units close by. Our storage units also include a 24/7 security
        camera system for each individual unit to ensure your stuff’s safety!
      </p>
      <h4>Our philosophy</h4>
      <p>
        Here at DirectSHED, we believe in giving our customers the highest
        quality and cheapest option for a storage unit as possible! We
        understand the college struggle, and we want to help in the best way we
        know how: good units for low prices. Don’t miss out, we sell out quick
        at the start of each BYUI semester!

      <h3>Prices</h3>
      <h4>Our prices</h4>
      <p>
        For our storage units, we offer the first month with us for
        <strong>free</strong>! After that first free month, you can rent our
        units for $30.00 a month. Each storage unit is 10 feet by 8 feet large,
        along with a 10-foot ceiling height. We also offer a unique price
        matching system, unlike any other storage units in town. If you manage
        to find a cheaper unit in Rexburg, we will offer you a cheaper price
        than what that unit offers! We want our customers to be as confident as
        we are that their money is being well spent with us.
      </p>
      <h4>Office hours</h4>
      <p>
        We are so confident with our security systems set in place that you are
        actually able to access your rented unit anytime, even when we aren’t
        there! While you are able to access your unit during all 24 hours of the
        day, we only offer customer service during the daytime from 9am-5pm from
        Monday through Saturday.

      <h3>Location</h3>
      <h4>Our location</h4>
      <p>
        The DirectSHED storage units are located on
        <strong>64 N 2nd E, Rexburg, ID 83440</strong>. We wanted to get our
        units as close as possible to the BYU-I campus (less than half a mile
        away!) to ensure that moving in and out of your apartments runs as
        smoothly as possible. Each storage unit is 10x8x10 feet. If you decide
        to give us a visit and are interested in renting a unit, you can talk to
        us at the front desk about more specific details and we can help you get
        it figured out!
      </p>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>
        The DirectSHED facility has state of the arc technology to ensure your
        unit is as safe as possible to only you. We offer 24/7 security
        recording, along with unique two-factor authentication locks on each
        unit that can be connected to your phone (also includes physical key).
